            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This game has no name. It is a game with perma-death meaning if you die, you will need to refresh
        your browser to start over. The game has 3 waves followed by a final boss. You can spend stat points
        on upgrades for your character, these upgrades include increases to health, damage and speed.</p>

            <h2>Controls</h2>
            <p>Use the controls WASD to move your character around the screen. Use the keys jkli to shoot in 4
        corresponding directions. Refresh the page to start over and click the green buttons to the right of the 
                stats to spend your skill points.</p>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>In this game you level up by defeating enemies. Once you level up you get skill points you can
                spend on the top of the gameplay screen. On top of the gameplay screen you'll notice a gui
                including level, skills, sp (skill points) and a green dot representing your health. When
                you spend skill points on your health you'll gain more green dots until you take damage.
                Enemies have a chance of dropping green circular health ups. These will repair a health
                point each, only use them when you lose health though otherwise it may be wasted.</p>
